# Easiest option: let RuuviBridge poll the gateway for measurements
#gateway_polling:
#  gateway_url: http://ip.or.hostname.of.the.gateway
#  interval: 10s

# Recommended option: Have the gateway send the measurements to a MQTT server and let RuuviBridge subscribe to updates in real time
#mqtt_listener:
#  broker_address: ip.or.hostname
#  broker_port: 1883
#  client_id: RuuviBridge
#  username: ruuvibridge
#  password: ruuvipassword
#  topic_prefix: ruuvi

# Extra processing of the values. Extended values are enabled by default but can be disabled by changing extended_values to false
#processing:
#  extended_values: true

# Supports both InfluxDB 1.8 and 2.x
# For 1.8 the auth_token is username and password in format "username:password" and bucket is the database name
influxdb_publisher:
  url: http://localhost:8086
  auth_token: changethis
  org: ""
  bucket: ruuvi
  measurement: ruuvi_measurements

# Optional names for the tags with the key being the mac address and value being the desired name
